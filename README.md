# BasicBatchAnalysisToolbox
Macro toolbox for basic batch analysis in ImageJ

This is a set of macros I started to develop during my PhD at Centre dâ€™Immunologie Marseille-Luminy in the team of Philippe Pierre. So far, they are individual macros, all functional, but not all with a finished UI. Some are better suited for running from macro editor. I will turn them into a proper toolbox over time.
